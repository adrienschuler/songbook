> [!example]- Lyrics
> I've overlooked so many things
Through the years  
Through my tears
Through the years
Then I went and opened my eyes.
>
You were my idea...
Heaven with open arms.
>
Now that I've found myself this once, 
I think that it is best  
We build our little nest
Hear the rest, yes it's best  
>
I won't stop and think of the things I really couldn't do until I met you.  
Please mama, listen to my plea, understand my love and you will find it true, love.  
I want you to know just how I feel right from the start and hope that you feel the same.  
I've never had the slighest doubt and hope I never will,  
I pray our love will blossom with each thrill,   
I hope you feel the same, please baby don't let me linger.  
Open up your soul when you open up your arms for me alone  
Then I know I'll find a way to make it plain, I love you.  
>
I thought of you, dear,   
You're the only one I've wanted since I have met you  
And I need you every moment, mama, stay by my side.  
I know we're meant to find true love, dear  
I vow you'll never leave me once I have you.  
I'll never know the song the bluebird sings when he's lonely.  
Well... it'll have to be, can't you see, I did used to wander,  
You can love me, tell me...do ya?  
For it is true, dear, there's no other but ya.  
Then I went and said it all over again,  
The way you made me love you, it's a sin  
...but what can I do?
