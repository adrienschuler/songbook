> Sandu - Lyrics by Melissa Oliveira  
> 
>They say it's hard to find, a state of mind  
blessed with harmony of every kind  
happiness will come and go,   
it ain't something you can keep and hold  
that's why stories from the cuckoo's nest appear   
like the man next door to me  
lost his mind suddenly  
they say he cherished life his lovely wife  
everything seemed fine, no signs of strife  
but things started going wrong  
his mind and he weren't getting along  
so that's why he just decided to set off on a venture to the Sandu  
>
>things of the mind and the soul are so hard to get under control   
so you've got to be careful,   
gotta watch out you just can never tell can you?  
this man he thought it would never happen   
he was happy life was going peachy until   
he began to hear funny voices going on inside his head   
troubling his spirit  
nobody seemed to understand exactly what had really happened  
until he lost it packed his things   
made his way for the door reassured  
said I'm on a journey to the desert,   
I can't go on living here better forget it!  
you just can never tell,   
Sandu certainly was a place where he could run form all his demons,   
definitely was a place where he could try   
to find some peace of mind and disappear   
without a trace without being heard from again....
