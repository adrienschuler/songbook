This is about love and about soul  
We get it on, we get it go  
No tiny gods, no tiny minds  
Cannot stop us jump of the lines

Cause.  
See the man right now,  
See the man now going down

We burst it up, we break out now  
We get it on, we turn around  
Its coming hard from upside down  
Sweet subversion from the underground

We get it on, we get it go  
We get you up from down below
