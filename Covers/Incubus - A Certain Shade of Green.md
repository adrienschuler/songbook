A certain shade of green  
Tell me is that what you mean?  
All signs around  
They say move ahead  
Could someone please explain to me  
Your ever present lack of speed

Are your muscles bound by ropes  
Or do crutches cloud your day  
My sources say the road is clear  
And street signs point the way

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?  
What are you waiting for?  
A certain shade of green  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate  
What are you waiting for?  
A certain shade of green!

Would a written invitation  
Signed choose now or lose it all?  
Sedate your hesitation  
Or inflame and make you stall

You've been raised in limitation  
But that glove never fit quite right  
The time has passed for hand me downs  
Choose a new  
Please evolve  
Take flight

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?  
What are you waiting for?  
A certain shade of green!  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate

Green...  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
A written invitation?  
A public declaration?  
A private consolation?  
Remember when you...

I think I grew a gray watching you... procrastinate!

You gonna stand around 'til 2012 AD?  
What are you waiting for?  
A certain shade of green!  
I think I grew a gray watching you procrastinate

What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for...
