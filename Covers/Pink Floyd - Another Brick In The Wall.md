We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teacher, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave them kids alone  
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall  
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

We don't need no education  
We don't need no thought control  
No dark sarcasm in the classroom  
Teachers, leave them kids alone

Hey, teacher, leave us kids alone  
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall  
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

How can you have any pudding if you don't eat yer meat?  
You! Yes, you behind the bike stands  
Stand still, laddy!
