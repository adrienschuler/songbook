A decade ago  
I never thought I would be at twenty-three  
On the verge of spontaneous combustion  
Woe-is-me  
But I guess that it comes with the territory  
An ominous landscape of never ending calamity  
I need you to hear  
I need you to see that I have had all that I can take  
And exploding seems like a definite possibility to me

So pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Not two days ago  
I was having a look in a book  
And I saw a picture of a guy fried up above his knee  
I said, "I can relate" 'cause lately I've been  
Thinking of combustication as a welcomed vacation from  
The burdens of the planet earth  
Like gravity, hypocrisy, and the perils of being in 3-D  
But thinking so much differently

Pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and it's people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same  
Never be the same, yeah

Pardon me while I burst into flames  
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me

So pardon me while I burst into flames  
I've had enough of the world and its people's mindless games  
So pardon me while I burn and rise above the flame  
Pardon me, pardon me, I'll never be the same

Pardon me, never be the same, yeah
